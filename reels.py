'''
The file README contains a general description of the program. Read on for implementation details.

reels.py is an A* search algorithm.

Nodes in the search graph consist of a partial solution built of one or more observed pieces and a list of free pieces, which are not yet represented in the solution.
In the start node, the partial solution contains only the largest single observed piece of the reel. All other pieces are free.
In the goal nodes, the solution is a complete sequence of observed pieces, some possibly overlapping with the next. The free list is empty.

To move from one node to the next, the program appends a free piece to the left or right of the partial solution.
The cost of the edge is the number of additional symbols in the partial solution after the operation.
Overlapping observations are therefore preferred to find a short solution.

To help with determining the cheapest path, the program uses an NxN matrix g_overlap, where N is the number of observed pieces.
g_overlap[i][j] is the number of overlapping symbols when appending g_obs[j] to the right of g_obs[i].

The heuristic function (estimated distance to goal) is the sum of minimum costs using g_overlap_left and g_overlap_right for every free piece.
