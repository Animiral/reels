# The file README contains a general description of the program. Read on for implementation details.

# reels.py is an A* search algorithm.

# Nodes in the search graph consist of a partial solution built of one or more observed pieces and a list of free pieces, which are not yet represented in the solution.
# In the start node, the partial solution contains only the largest single observed piece of the reel. All other pieces are free.
# In the goal nodes, the solution is a complete sequence of observed pieces, some possibly overlapping with the next. The free list is empty.

# To move from one node to the next, the program appends a free piece to the left or right of the partial solution.
# The cost of the edge is the number of additional symbols in the partial solution after the operation.
# Overlapping observations are therefore preferred to find a short solution.

# To help with determining the cheapest path, the program uses an NxN matrix g_overlap, where N is the number of observed pieces.
# g_overlap[i][j] is the number of overlapping symbols when appending g_obs[j] to the right of g_obs[i].

# The heuristic function (estimated distance to goal) is the sum of minimum costs using g_overlap_left and g_overlap_right for every free piece.
